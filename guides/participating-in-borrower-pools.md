## Learning about Borrower Pools

#### How Borrower Pools work

Read about Borrower Pools and on the [Backers page](../protocol-mechanics/backers.md). Read about Borrowers and their incentives on the [Borrowers](../protocol-mechanics/borrowers.md) page.

#### Understanding the risks

<mark style="color:red;">**It is important to understand that you can lose money by participating in the Senior Pool.**</mark> If a Borrower doesn't repay the amount they borrow, you will lose your relative portion of that amount. By participating as a Backer, you are taking higher risk by providing first-loss capital â€” when a Borrower pays back a portion of what they owe, that payment is first applied to the Senior Pool before it is applied to Backers. Therefore, it is possible for Borrowers to make partial repayments and for you to still lose 100% of the amount you supplied.

#### When Borrower Pools are open

You can only participate in a Borrower Pool when a Borrower Pool is open. A pool can be open either because 1) a new Borrower pool is being raised, or 2) a portion of an existing Borrower pool has opened up. Otherwise, the dapp will show that the pool is `full` and you will no longer be able to supply more capital. You can look out for announcements to see when new Borrower Pools are going to be open.

#### Announcements

Typically, once a Borrower Pool is open, the community shares announcements using [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/HVeaca3fN8) and/or Telegram. This announcement will contain a [Pool Overview](https://files.gitbook.com/v0/b/gitbook-x-prod.appspot.com/o/spaces%2F-MlGaVCGIXm8i0k0uhfS%2Fuploads%2FkuplVhYH6Lz4IlUCuXPT%2FSample\_Pool\_Overview.pdf?alt=media\&token=39f94f57-aa32-4e3b-8fdc-0117ad3cce37) (an example), which describes the deal in depth. It typically holds the key terms of the loan agreement, the repayment schedule, FAQs, and other resources.

#### **Getting more details about Borrower Pools**

Usually, the Pool Overview includes a Non-Disclosure Agreement for you to sign. (Read more about NDA's [here](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/n/nda.asp).) This will give you access to the due diligence data room containing information provided by the Borrower. Each individual Goldfinch Backer is responsible for doing thorough due diligence on their own investments and deciding whether it's a good opportunity for them.

In addition, after you sign the NDA, there is usually a deal-specific Telegram group and/or Discord channel you will be invited to join. There, you can ask Borrowers questions directly, both about who they are and the specifics of the deal.&#x20;

## Supplying to Borrower Pools

Each Borrower Pool has a unique set of requirements, which are announced on the Goldfinch Discord server. But typically, the steps are:

1. Join [Discord](https://discord.com/invite/HVeaca3fN8) or [Telegram](https://t.me/goldfinch\_finance) and keep an eye out for announcements about Borrower Pools opening. If you aren't sure whether there were recent announcements, ask in the Discord.
2. [Verify your identity](verifying-your-identity.md).
3. When the pool is open, visit [https://app.goldfinch.finance/earn](https://app.goldfinch.finance/earn) and click on the pool in the `Borrower Pools` list.&#x20;
   1. Note: when a Borrower pool is full, it will say "full" in the top right corner of the row.
4. On the pool page, click `Supply` to view the form. Review the agreement that is linked to understand what you are signing, enter your full name (this is your signature), and enter the amount of USDC you want to supply.
   1. Note: You will be required to enter your real world full legal name, and this name will be added to the real world transaction agreement. This gives you all the associated rights, benefits, and security of the transaction you are investing in.
   2. Note: Sometimes, pools will have a cap on the maximum amount that can be supplied. You may need to adjust your amount accordingly.
5. Click `I Agree`.
6. Accept the transaction on MetaMask.
7. Done. You should now see the additional USDC in your balance at the top of the page.
   1. Note: When you supply to a Borrower Pool, you receive an NFT that acts a "digital receipt"  representing the amount you supplied.

## Withdrawing from Backer Pools

{% hint style="info" %}
After you supply capital, you can withdraw up until the time when the Borrower Pool is locked (which typically happens once when the pool is full). After the Borrower draws down the capital, you will not be able to withdraw until the Borrower makes repayments. As the Borrower makes repayments, you will be able to withdraw your relative portion of those payments.
{% endhint %}

1. Go to the pool page.
2. Click `Withdraw` and enter the amount of USDC you want to withdraw
3. Click `Submit.`
4. `Accept` the transaction on MetaMask.
5. Done. You should now see the additional USDC in your wallet.

## FAQ

#### **What cryptoassets can I supply to  Borrower Pools?**

Borrower Pools only supports USDC.

#### **When do I receive yield?**

You receive yield each time the Borrower makes an interest payment into the Borrower Pools.&#x20;

#### **Do I need to sign a Non-Disclosure Agreement (NDA) to invest as a Backer?**

Technically no, but it's strongly recommended that you do sign the NDA in order to review the full due diligence materials about the Borrower Pools you participate in.

#### **What happens if I provide a fake name when I supply capital?**

You will essentially forfeit your legal rights to the real-world loan document you are signing. You will still be able to supply capital into the Borrower Pool and receive your portion of repayments made on-chain. However, you will have no real-world legal recourse. The Borrower and other Backers will additionally have no obligations to make any repayments to you in the event that there is a a default and they come to a decision regarding how to resolve it.

#### **Are Backers able to take legal action if Borrowers default?**

Yes, if there is a real-world legal agreement between the Borrower and Backers. When you enter your full name, you are directly signing the agreement with the Borrower that is linked in the form. The process by which a Backer can take action against a Borrower will depend on the specific real-world documents related to the pool a Backer invested in.

#### Is it necessary for the Backer portion of the pool to be filled before the Borrower locks the pool and draws down capital?

No, the Borrower can lock the pool and drawdown at any time. Moreover, in theory, it is also possible for the Backers to fill beyond the limit, which would reduce the leverage and expected APY for Backers. The limit displayed on the dapp is just imposed on the frontend as a way to ensure the APY stays at the expected level.
