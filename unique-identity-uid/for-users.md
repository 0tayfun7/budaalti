## How to get your UID&#x20;

As of January 26, 2022, U.S. individuals can obtain a Unique Identity (UID). This will allow US-based GFI holders to participate in [governance](https://docs.goldfinch.finance/goldfinch/governance#participation). However, only U.S. accredited investors will be able to participate in supplying capital to the protocol.

### Step 1: Sign In&#x20;

Head over to https://app.goldfinch.finance/verify. Click the “Sign In” button and use MetaMask to sign in to Goldfinch with the MetaMask address you’d like to use with the protocol.

### Step 2: Verify your MetaMask address&#x20;

Self-identify as an individual or entity, US-based or non-US, and — for US-based — accredited or non-accredited. For non-US individuals and US non-accredited individuals, you’ll then be prompted to enter your contact information and will be redirected to Persona — the Goldfinch protocol’s identity verification partner — to complete an identification check. Please have your ID ready and be prepared to take a quick selfie.

For entities (both US and non-US) and US accredited investors, you’ll then be prompted to visit the Goldfinch bridge site on Parallel Markets to complete the KYC/KYB process. Once your KYC/KYB (and accreditation, if applicable) are verified, someone from the Goldfinch community will be in touch via email within 24 business hours asking for your wallet address that will hold your UID. Once your address is provided, you will receive a second email notification when you can proceed with minting your UID.

Completing this step will allow you to participate in the Senior Pool.

### Step 3: Create your UID&#x20;

Once you have successfully verified your identity, return to https://app.goldfinch.finance/verify to mint your UID.. To do this, click on “Create UID” and confirm the NFT minting transaction.

Note that minting the UID NFT will cost 0.00083 ETH + gas fees. This is to cover the fees incurred by the protocol for conducting an identity verification via Persona, a 3rd party service provider.

You can view your NFT after it’s been minted by searching for your Metamask account on Opensea. Once you have this NFT, you will be able to participate in Goldfinch as an LP and/or a Backer. As described in the white paper, Backers are able to earn higher yields than the Senior Pool liquidity providers by staking USDC in junior tranches of Borrower Pools.
