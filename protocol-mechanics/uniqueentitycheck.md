# Unique Entity Check

Because the Leverage Model relies on "trust through consensus", and also to help avoid [Sybil Attacks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sybil\_attack), it is critical for the protocol to have confidence that each Borrower, Backer, and Auditor is a unique entity. Therefore, they must each be verified with a `Unique Entity Check` before they can participate.

Currently, the protocol uses [Unique Identity (UID)](../unique-identity-uid/) as its Unique Entity Check provider. View the [Unique Identity (UID)](../unique-identity-uid/) section of the documentation to learn about UID, how it works, and how to get started.&#x20;
