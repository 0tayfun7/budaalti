# Stage 0: Preliminary Actions and Decisions

Below are some of the early actions you will need to take when exploring a deal on the Goldfinch protocol:

* **Create your Metamask Wallet**: As described above, you will need a Metamask wallet to interact with the Goldfinch Protocol. You should set this up as soon as possible. You can begin the process of setting up your wallet [here](https://metamask.io/)
* **Open your Crypto Exchange Account:** You will also need to set up your business account at a crypto exchange to help you convert from fiat to crypto and vice versa. This can be a time-consuming process, so we advise you to get started on this as soon as possible. [Here](broken-reference) are some crypto exchanges we would recommend. Please let us know if you would like introductions to any of the below
* **Open a Bank Account with a Crypto-Friendly Bank**: Please begin the process of opening a bank account with a crypto-friendly bank. As you will be receiving large sums of money from your crypto exchange account, it is important to work with a bank that is amenable to crypto transactions. Please see below a list of banks that we would recommend
* **Familiarize yourself with communications platforms** like Discord, Telegram, Signal, etc. which you need to communicate with the Goldfinch community during your raise process. You can learn more about these [here](broken-reference).
* **Counsel**: Select counsel which is familiar with securities law in the jurisdiction into which you are raising. Your counsel would be responsible for all securities and disclosure advice. Please refer to the KYC Requirements in the Legal Considerations mentioned above for context.
