#### **Where can I find the updates of the Goldfinch Protocol?**

You can find all the updates in the the [Goldfinch Discord](https://discord.com/invite/HVeaca3fN8) server, [Telegram](https://t.me/goldfinch\_finance), [Twitter](https://twitter.com/goldfinch\_fi), and sometimes on [Medium.](https://medium.com/goldfinch-fi)

#### **I don't speak English. Will Goldfinch dapp be available in my language?**

The app is still in English. However, there are different language channels set up in Discord - Russian, Ukrainian, Korean, Turkish, Indonesian, Vietnamese, Spanish, among others. These channels are great for asking any questions, and whenever an announcement goes out in English, these channels share a translated version. Community members have volunteered to translate the content into different languages, and any member should feel empowered to [request](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfMo9JSudo0LTGsNG5uKT6bBPtD5hF0Rod7rVlQIXJ9QHnMSw/viewform) to have one, and the community moderators will set it up if there is a high need.

#### **Is Goldfinch a blockchain?**

No, it is not. Goldfinch is being built on top of the Ethereum blockchain.

#### **Are the smart contracts open source?**

Yes. Here is a link to the Github repository: [https://github.com/goldfinch-eng/goldfinch-contracts](https://github.com/goldfinch-eng/goldfinch-contracts).

#### Does Goldfinch h**ave a Bug Bounty program?**

Yes, Goldfinch has a [Bug Bounty program](https://immunefi.com/bounty/goldfinch/) in partnership with Immunefi.

#### **Does the dapp support MetaMask, Ledger, and Trezor?**

Both MetaMask and Ledger work, and perform optimally through Firefox. Trezor is currently not supported.

#### What is the currency of the loans?

All loans are in USDC. You can learn more about USDC [here](https://www.circle.com/en/usdc).

#### Does Goldfinch really take no collateral in its deals?

Goldfinch does not ask Borrowers to deposit any on-chain collateral to take out a loan. Instead, when structuring a loan, Borrowers are required to pledge real-world assets as collateral.&#x20;

#### **Has the Goldfinch protocol been audited?**

Yes, by [Certik](https://www.certik.com) and [Trail of Bits](https://www.trailofbits.com). The initial V2 of the protocol (the design outlined in the white paper) has been audited by Certik (here is the [Github repo](https://github.com/goldfinch-eng/goldfinch-contracts)). Another audit was done by Trail of Bits (https://www.trailofbits.com/) in November 2021 (here is the [Github repo](https://github.com/goldfinch-eng/goldfinch-contracts)).

#### **Who are the current Borrowers using the protocol?**

The list of past borrowers is available publicly [here](https://app.goldfinch.finance/earn) under `Borrower Pools`.

#### I heard about "Flight Academy", what was that?

Flight Academy was a program that empowered the Backer community with tools and basic vocabulary needed to evaluate Debt Capital Markets deals. The program aimed to establish community values and set community norms. The academy ran from September 20, 2021, to October 25, 2021. The academy tutorials are [available](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4hGungwsEQk\&list=PLJsUPOCzOm\_zJ08Mgc0vLs-1pymgcO2\_-) for free. Participants were rewarded with GFI (Goldfinch's token) based on a specific criteria, as explained in the final announcements [here](https://discord.com/channels/793925570739044362/806257997680345188/921477436024168548), and [here](https://discord.com/channels/793925570739044362/806257997680345188/922571454917247036).&#x20;

Currently, the community has not proposed hosting another Flight Academy. However, community members should feel empowered to propose one through governance.&#x20;

#### **Backer Rewards vs. LP Rewards**

There have been a lot of questions about the fact that retroactive distributions happened on launch day (Jan 11th) for LPs and not for Backers. Per the white paper and todayâ€™s announcement, Backers should expect to receive distributions for participating in Borrower Pools. Smart contracts for Backer distributions have already been audited and deployed, and are already on the community Github repo [here](https://github.com/goldfinch-eng/mono/blob/main/packages/protocol/contracts/rewards/BackerRewards.sol). In order for these changes to go live, the community governance just needs to vote to adopt these changes, and add it to the front-end dapp. That proposal could also include a retroactive airdrop for the Backers as well, with exact amounts to be decided by the community.\
You can submit or discuss a proposal for Backer Rewards at [gov.goldfinch.finance](https://gov.goldfinch.finance).
