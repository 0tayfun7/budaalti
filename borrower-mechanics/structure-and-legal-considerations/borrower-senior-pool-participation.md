# Borrower Senior Pool Participation

It is important to note that neither the Senior Pool nor the investors in the Senior Pool are lenders of record. The Senior Pool participates in the economics of the transaction by virtue of the protocol design (i.e. the smart contract).

All Senior Pool investors sign up to the [following agreement](https://app.goldfinch.finance/senior-pool-agreement-non-us), covering Reg D and non-US requirements, ahead of being able to access the Goldfinch protocol.

{% hint style="warning" %}
Borrowers should consult with their own legal, tax, and regulatory counsel to review the above agreement in relation to other documents executed by Backers in their raise
