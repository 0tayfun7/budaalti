# Sample Backer Economics

Let's take the below deal terms as an example of how back-leverage works:

****

**Hypothetical Transaction:**

* Facility Size - $5,000,000
* Borrower Coupon - 12%
  * Senior Net Coupon = % Gross Coupon - 20% Junior Relocation - 10% Pool Reserve
  * Junior Net Coupon = % Gross Coupon + 20% Junior Relocation - 10% Pool Reserve
* Leverage Ratio - 4x
* Backer Investment: $1,000,000
* Senior Pool Investment: $4,000,000

**Senior Pool Economics:** 8.4%

**Backer Economics:** 20.4%

****

The table below shows the economics for both the Backers and the Senior Pool for a Borrower Pool with details above. You can download this sheet [here](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1NB3kXFQTh3CxMhJSk8hHlMhgtxlcz8hBsaVu0O\_JjEg/edit?usp=sharing).
