# Getting started

The dapp is how backers, borrowers, and the rest of the Goldfinch community participate in the protocol. In order to interact with the dapp and begin engaging with Borrower Pools, you will need to do the following steps:

1. **Click "Connect Wallet" on the top right corner.** You can connect your wallet using WalletConnect or Metamask. If you do not have a wallet, click "I don't have a wallet" to set one up
2. **Verify your identity.** [Learn how to do that here](verifying-your-identity.md).
3. **Explore the dapp**
   1. View all of the pools and a summary of your holdings on the [Earn page](https://app.goldfinch.finance/earn).
   2. View the Senior Pool page, and [participate as a Liquidity Provider](participating-in-the-senior-pool.md).
   3. View the Borrower Pool pages, and [participate as a Backer](participating-in-borrower-pools.md).
4. **(Highly encouraged) Join the** [**Discord**](https://discord.com/invite/HVeaca3fN8)**!** The Discord is a great place to ask the community for help with any questions you have along the way, stay in touch with announcements about different [Borrower Pools ](broken-reference)opening up, and generally participate in the community.
