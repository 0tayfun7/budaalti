# Token Launch FAQ

#### How will I know if I received GFI?

Go to [https://app.goldfinch.finance/gfi](https://app.goldfinch.finance/gfi). If you have received GFI tokens, you will see it listed with an `Accept` button to accept them.

#### **How can I receive more GFI?**

You can receive more tokens through [liquidity mining](../protocol-mechanics/senior-pool-liquidity-mining.md) as a Liquidity Provider. Learn [how to participate in liquidity mining here](../guides/participating-in-liquidity-mining.md).&#x20;

#### **How can I claim my GFI?**

See [Claiming GFI distributions](../guides/claiming-gfi-distributions.md).

#### **Why can't I claim all my GFI? What is 'unlocking'?**

Some distributions are not all immediately available, but instead "unlock" according to a schedule. For example, a 2-year unlock schedule means you will gradually be able to claim more and more of your distribution, eventually being able to claim 100% after 2 years.

The frequency with which more of your GFI becomes claimable is the "unlock interval". For example, if the unlock schedule is monthly, that means new amounts of the GFI distribution will become claimable on a monthly cadence.

#### **I was a Liquidity Provider in the Senior Pool before Token Launch. Will I get tokens?**

Yes, if you are a non-U.S. person. Existing Liquidity Providers were allocated GFI distributions during the token launch —  see how they were allocated on the [Tokenomics page](./). In addition, existing Liquidity Providers can receive more tokens through [liquidity mining](../protocol-mechanics/senior-pool-liquidity-mining.md) by staking their FIDU.

#### **I was a community member on Discord. Will I receive GFI?**

The only community members who received GFI during the Token Launch were those who held the "role names" of Community Managers, Admin, and Contributors for their excellence and support in handling the community. A few select Artists and Developers from the community also received GFI. However, in the near future, the community may want to set up community-run grants programs which will allow other community members to earn GFI.

#### **Can GFI be staked?**

No — GFI, the Goldfinch Protocol token, cannot be "staked" right now.

To avoid confusion, there are two unrelated types of "staking" on Goldfinch:

* When people supply capital to the Senior Pool, they receive [FIDU](../protocol-mechanics/liquidityproviders.md#fidu). They can then stake that FIDU to participate in Liquidity Mining and earn GFI.
* According to the [white paper](https://goldfinch.finance/goldfinch\_whitepaper.pdf), in the future GFI may be used for staking (on Backers), but this functionality is currently not in place.

#### **Can I use GFI for anything while it's unlocking?**

No — GFI can only be used once it is in your wallet. Sometimes, you may have GFI that is claimable, but not in your wallet. To transfer unlocked GFI to your wallet,  `Claim` for the GFI on the `GFI` tab in the [dapp](https://app.goldfinch.finance).&#x20;

#### **Can I transfer my GFI tokens to a Ledger?**

Yes, after you have claimed your GFI. Ledger supports ERC20 tokens like GFI.

#### **I was a Backer for one or more Borrower Pools. Will I get GFI?**

Currently, the functionality is not in place for the Backers to receive GFI for participating in  Borrower Pools. However, according to the white paper, this is a functionality that will be developed over the upcoming months, pending community approval.&#x20;
