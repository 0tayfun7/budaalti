# Goldfinch's Borrowers

You can learn more about Borrowers and the role they play in the protocol in the [Borrowers](../../protocol-mechanics/borrowers.md) section of the Protocol Mechanics documentation.

* Borrowers are able to raise unitranche loan structure allowing them to pay a single interest rate with all interest and principal payments made into a single portal
* Borrowers have the ability to propose any investments based on any terms, and transaction structures to the Goldfinch community
* The Goldfinch ecosystem was built to be generalized allowing for many Borrower archetypes that could raise capital through it. Some examples Borrower types include, but are not limited to:
  * Credit Funds
  * Fintechs
