# Stage 2: Dataroom Preparation

In preparation for Backer due diligence, you will need to stand up a virtual dataroom. For this, we recommend you use a virtual dataroom service that allows you to track investor engagement (e.g. [Docsend](https://docsend.com/)).

At the minimum, your dataroom should include:

* An overview speaking to your historical performance
* Material speaking to the performance of your borrowers
* Transaction structure and security overview document explaining how security works in the instance of a default
* Agreements you have in place with your borrowers
* Deal Specific Documentation such as:
  * Term sheets
  * Loan Agreements
  * Security Agreements
  * Any other transaction documents you think necessary
