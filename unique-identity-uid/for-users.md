## How to get your UID

_Please note that currently the Goldfinch protocol is only open to participants outside the US. Anyone from the U.S. who completes Steps 1 and 2 be notified once the protocol is open for U.S.-based participants._

_If you have already verified you identification for Goldfinch, you may be able to skip steps 1 and 2 or skip the entire process depending on when you completed verification. To see which steps you can skip go to: https://app.goldfinch.finance/verify and sign in using your verified Metamask address._

**For all new non-U.S. participants: **

### Step 1: Sign In

Head over to https://app.goldfinch.finance/verify. Click the “Sign In” button and use Metamask to sign in to Goldfinch with the Metamask address you’d like to use with the protocol.&#x20;

### Step 2: Verify your Metamask address

Select whether you represent a non-U.S. individual, a U.S. individual or an entity. You’ll then be prompted to enter your contact information and will be redirected to Persona - the Goldfinch protocol’s identity verification partner - to complete an identification check. Please have your ID ready and be prepared to take a quick selfie. Completing this step will allow you to participate in the Senior Pool.&#x20;

### Step 3: Create your UID

Once you have successfully verified your identity, you will be redirected back to the frontend application, where you can create your UID. To do this, click on “Create UID” and confirm the NFT minting transaction. Note that minting the UID NFT will cost 0.00083 ETH + gas fees. This is to cover the fees incurred by the protocol for conducting an identity verification via Persona, a 3rd party service provider. You can view your NFT after it’s been minted by searching for your Metamask account on Opensea. Once you have this NFT, you will be able to participate in Goldfinch as a Backer. As described in the white paper, Backers are able to earn higher yields than the Senior Pool liquidity providers by staking USDC in junior tranches of Borrower Pools.

### Step 4: Earn!
