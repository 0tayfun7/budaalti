# Participating in liquidity mining

### Senior Pool Liquidity Mining

Currently, liquidity mining is only live for the Senior Pool. Learn more about how [Senior Pool liquidity Mining works here](../protocol-mechanics/investor-incentives/senior-pool-liquidity-mining.md).

#### If you're participating in the Senior Pool for the first time:

1. See how to [participate in the Senior Pool here](participating-in-the-senior-pool.md).
2. In the Supply form, make sure to check the box to stake your supply.&#x20;
3. Once you complete the Supply transaction, you will start receiving GFI distributions from Senior Pool liquidity mining.

#### If you have already supplied to the Senior Pool and have FIDU:

1. On the [Senior Pool page](https://app.goldfinch.finance/pools/senior), you should see a prompt describe the unstaked FIDU you have with an option to "Stake All FIDU".
2. Click on the "Stake All FIDU" button to approve and stake your unstaked FIDU.
3. Once you complete the Stake transaction, you will start receiving GFI distributions from Senior Pool liquidity mining.

### View your GFI

You can view the GFI you receive from liquidity mining on the `GFI` tab. Learn more about [claiming GFI here](claiming-gfi-distributions.md).
