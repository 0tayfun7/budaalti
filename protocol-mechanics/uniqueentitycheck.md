# Unique Entity Check

Since the Leverage Model relies on "trust through consensus", it is critical to avoid sybil attacks by having confidence that each Borrower, Backer, and Auditor is a unique entity. Therefore, they must each be verified with a `Unique Entity Check` before they can participate.

Currently, the protocol uses [Unique Identity (UID)](../unique-identity-uid/) as its Unique Entity Check provider.
