# Governance

Governance is managed by a community DAO and has the ability to perform maintenance functions and parameter adjustments to the protocol via decentralized voting, including:

* Upgrading contracts
* Changing protocol configurations and parameters
* Selecting Unique Entity Check providers
* Setting the rewards and distribution of GFI
* Pausing protocol activity in the event of an emergency

## Participation

Anyone can participate in governance by making proposals, discussing them, and participating in Snapshot votes.

#### Governance Forum

The Goldfinch community governance portal is located at [https://gov.goldfinch.finance/](https://gov.goldfinch.finance/). This is a venue for the community to make and discuss proposals. More details on the proposal process are at the governance portal [here](https://gov.goldfinch.finance/t/welcome-to-the-goldfinch-governance-forum/37).&#x20;

#### Snapshot Votes

Snapshot votes take place at [https://snapshot.org/#/goldfinch.eth](https://snapshot.org/#/goldfinch.eth). You can use your GFI balance to vote, and the results are calculated according to [Quadratic Voting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadratic\_voting). To ensure sybil resistance with quadratic voting, participants need a [Unique Identity NFT (UID)](unique-identity-uid/) in order to vote.
