# Verifying your identity

{% hint style="warning" %}
Please note: Anyone can verify their identity, but U.S. persons cannot participate in the Senior Pool or Borrower Pools even if they have verified their identity.
{% endhint %}

It is necessary to verify your identity in order to participate in Governance votes or supply to the Senior Pool and Borrower Pools. The identity verification process checks that you are a real individual, and then allows you to mint your UID. The process uses [Persona](https://withpersona.com) to perform the verification, which takes privacy and security [very seriously](https://support.withpersona.com/hc/en-us/articles/360057452513-Security-privacy-and-compliance-overview).

## Step 1: Verify your address

1. Go to [https://app.goldfinch.finance/verify](https://app.goldfinch.finance/verify). If you visit the Senior Pool or Borrower Pool pages before verifying, they will prompt you to first verify on this page.
2. In the Verify your address section, choose whether you are a Non-U.S. Individual, U.S. Individual, or Entity.
3. For individuals, you will be prompted to provide your email and (optional) Discord username (from the [Goldfinch Discord](https://discord.com/invite/HVeaca3fN8) server).
4. Click `Verify ID` to start the process with Persona. You will be asked to upload a passport or national ID. **Passports are strongly recommended as Persona currently does not support some forms of national IDs.**
5. After uploading your ID, you will see the `Let's make sure it's you`  popup and you will be prompted to take photos of the front and sides of your face.
6. Done! The page should say you have successfully verified your address.

Disclaimer: Generally, the address verification process is instant. However, sometimes it can take some time for individuals to get verified. To ensure that you are instantly verified, see the tips below.
{% endhint %}

### **Helpful tips**

Your identity is tied to your Ethereum account address, and you can only have one verified account. Unfortunately, there are some regions like China that the Goldfinch protocol currently does not support.

Here are some tips to ensure that the verification is successful at the first attempt.

* Ensure that the Identification Document (ID) you are using is an ID type that is accepted by Persona.
* Passport is strongly recommended as an identification document, since Persona may not recognize some local IDs.
* Make sure your ID has a full legal name (given name + surname), a recent picture, your birthdate, and is not expired.
* When using a residence permit as an ID, make sure you take pictures of both front and back.
* Use a phone or computer to take a picture of your ID and do not run it through an image editing software.
* If you have registered on Persona once using a different Ethereum address, you will not be able to register again.
* Some older forms of IDs, like domestic passports, may not work.&#x20;

## Step 2: Mint your UID

Unique Identity (UID) is a non-transferrable NFT representing Know-Your-Customer identity verification on chain. It is the first NFT for identity. Learn more about UID [here](../unique-identity-uid/).&#x20;

{% hint style="info" %}
Please note you will need enough ETH in your address to cover 0.00083 ETH + gas fees. The additional 0.00083 ETH helps cover the fees for the Persona service.

1. Once you have completed your address verification (described above), you will be able to mint your UID
2. On the same page, click `Create UID`.
3. Click `Confirm` in the MetaMask popup. \
