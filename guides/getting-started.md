# Getting Started on Goldfinch

The Goldfinch decentralized application (dapp), [app.goldfinch.finance](https://app.goldfinch.finance/), is how Investors, Borrowers, and the rest of the Goldfinch community participate in the protocol.&#x20;

There are only a few high-level steps required to interact with the dapp to start investing:

1. **Navigate to** [app.goldfinch.finance](https://app.goldfinch.finance/)
2. **Click "Connect Wallet" on the top right corner:** Currently, the Goldfinch dapp supports WalletConnect or Metamask. If you do not have a wallet, click "I don't have a wallet" to set one up.&#x20;
3. **Verify your identity:** We'll cover how to mint a UID in the next page, [Verifying Your Identity](verifying-your-identity.md).
4. **Explore the dapp:**
   1. View all of the Borrower Pools and a summary of your holdings on the [Earn page](https://app.goldfinch.finance/earn)
   2. View the Senior Pool page, and [participate as a Liquidity Provider](participating-in-the-senior-pool.md)
   3. View the Borrower Pool pages, and [participate as a Backer](participating-in-borrower-pools.md)
5. **(Highly encouraged) Join the** [**Discord**](https://discord.com/invite/HVeaca3fN8)**!** The Discord is a great place to ask the community for help with any questions you have along the way, stay in touch with announcements about different [Borrower Pools](broken-reference), and generally participate in the community.
