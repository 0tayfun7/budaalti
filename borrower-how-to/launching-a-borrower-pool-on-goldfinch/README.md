# Launching a Borrower Pool on Goldfinch

As you look to launch a borrower pool on the Goldfinch protocol, here are the operational considerations you should take into account. For simplicity, we have broken this down into stages. We recommend budgeting a minimum two months of operational prep ahead of your initial launch on the platform.&#x20;

Currently, as a first step anyone who is interested in Borrowing on Goldfinch should fill out the [Borrower Inquiry form](https://q5mtp1r5w13.typeform.com/goldfinchborrow).&#x20;

{% hint style="warning" %}
**Goldfinch provides tools to help participants interact with the protocol, but it is your responsibility to stay compliant with all legal, regulatory, and tax laws for your relevant jurisdiction(s). All protocol participants are strongly encouraged to consult with their own legal and tax counsel.**&#x20;
